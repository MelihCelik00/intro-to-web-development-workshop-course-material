<h2> What is REST API? </h2>
REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer, which means Representational State Transfer. REST uses specific functions such as GET, PUT, DELETE for clients to access server data. Clients and servers exchange data over HTTP.

The main feature of REST API is its statelessness. Being stateless means that servers do not save client data between requests. The requests sent by the client to the server are similar to the URLs you type in your browser to visit a website. The response received contains only simple data that we are used to seeing on a web page, without any graphics.

<h2>What are the advantages of REST APIs?</h2>
There are four main advantages of REST APIs:

<h4>1. Integration </h4>
APIs are used to integrate new applications into existing software systems. Since there is no need to write each function from scratch, development speed increases. You can use APIs to continue to benefit from existing code.

<h4>2. Innovation </h4>
The arrival of a new application can force an entire industry to change. Businesses need to respond quickly and support the rapid distribution of innovative services. They can achieve this by making changes at the API level instead of rewriting all the code.

<h4>3. Expansion</h4>
APIs offer a unique opportunity for businesses that want to meet their customers' needs on multiple platforms. For example, the Maps API allows map information integration through websites, Android, iOS, etc. Each business can provide access to its own internal databases using free or paid APIs.

<h4>4. Easy Maintenance</h4>
API acts as a gateway between two systems. Each system needs to make internal changes to ensure that the API is not affected. This way, code changes made by one party in the future do not affect the other party.
