<h2> What is an API?</h2>

APIs are mechanisms that allow two software components to communicate with each other through specific definitions and protocols. For example, the software system of the meteorology department includes daily weather data. The weather application on your phone "talks" to this system through APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.


<h2>What does API stand for?</h2>
API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software that has a separate function. Interface can be thought of as a service contract between two applications. This contract defines how the two will communicate with each other using requests and responses. Associated API documents contain information on how developers should structure these requests and responses.


<h2>How do APIs work?</h2>
API architecture is generally explained in terms of clients and servers. The application that sends the request is called the client, and the application that sends the response is called the server. So, in the weather example, the meteorology department's weather database is a server, while the mobile application is a client.

APIs can work in four different ways depending on when and how they were created.

<h3>SOAP APIs</h3>
These APIs use Simple Object Access Protocol. The client and server exchange messages through XML. This is an API that is less flexible than others and has lost its popularity.

<h3>RPC APIs</h3>
These APIs are called Remote Procedure Calls. The client first completes a function (i.e., procedure) on the server and then the server sends the output to the client.

<h3>WebSocket APIs</h3>
WebSocket APIs are another modern web API that uses JSON objects to transfer data. A WebSocket API supports bidirectional communication between client applications and servers. It is more efficient than REST APIs because the server can send callback messages to connected clients.

<h3>REST APIs</h3>
These are the most popular and flexible APIs found on the web today. The client sends its requests to the server as data. The server uses this client input to initiate internal functions and sends output data back to the client. Let's examine REST APIs in more detail below.
